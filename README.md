This product is hereby licensed under the MIT license. It can be viewed [here](https://github.com/itsmaclol/macscript/blob/main/LICENSE).

Backups are recommended, continue at your own risk.

## Installation

jq is REQUIRED for macscript to work correctly, so install it via `brew install jq` or `apt install jq`

Just run the following in your terminal:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsmaclol/macscript/main/macscript.sh)"`


macscript-gui is not the best version of macscript and highly unstable, use macscript-cli for better performance.

macn1x (bootable Linux distro for macscript) is coming soon.

Check out the [GUI](https://github.com/itsmaclol/macscript-gui)
